### Description
Pic_Spider in Python, Ansi-style<br/>
I was going to write a Baidu-tieba spider, now can capture multiple web-sites because of adding function<br/>
version 1.0, the most simple spider, joined to create the folder<br/>
version 2.0, improved UI, optimized the code, can adapt to more types of tags and web-sites, and name pictures to avoid covering each other<br/>
version 3.0, joined the keyword (regular suffix) function, because the type and number of pictures'url are a lot<br/>
version 4.0, optimized the keyword (regular prefix) function, for more accurate<br/>
### Method
1st step, run Spider<br/>
2nd step, in the 1st text-box "Folder:" input file path, if the path exists then jump to the 3rd step, if do not exist then click the "Create" button to create a folder<br/>
3rd step, in the 2nd text box "Name:" to save the name of the pictures of the prefix, because the pictures may be far more than one, the suffix according to the number of pictures<br/>
4th step, in the 3rd text box "Regop:" and "Reged:" input keywords, you want to grab the elements on the right button to review the elements, for example:<br/><br/>

<img style="height: 700px;" src="https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1429095687696-3227bb0aa9a8?q=75&amp;fm=jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bf9adea15c02d630f71971a0dbbe1ed4" class="img-responsive js-fluid-image js-packery-image" alt="Photo By Shlomit Wolf" data-width="3888" data-height="2592"><br/><br/>

you can know, src = "path of image" is cited pictures format, but keyword prefix and suffix may not the same, here is " class" (with particular attention to the spaces), baidu is mostly "pic_sytle", different period ties' format aren't the same<br/>
5th step, in the 4th text box "Url:" input the URL, and then click on the "DownLoad" button, if you do not download the success, please check the key word<br/>
