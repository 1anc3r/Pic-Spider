# Pic Spider
## Summary
Pic Spider in Python, Ansi-style
I was going to write a Baidu-tieba spider, now can capture multiple web-sites because of adding function.
version 1.0, the most simple spider, joined to create the folder.
version 2.0, improved UI, optimized the code, can adapt to more types of tags and web-sites, and name pictures to avoid covering each other.
version 3.0, joined the keyword (regular suffix) function, because the type and number of pictures'url are a lot.
version 4.0, optimized the keyword (regular prefix) function, for more accurate.

## Instructions
1. run Spider.
2. in the 1st text-box "Folder:" input file path, if the path exists then jump to the 3rd step, if do not exist then click the "Create" button to create a folder.
3. in the 2nd text box "Name:" to save the name of the pictures of the prefix, because the pictures may be far more than one, the suffix according to the number of pictures.
4. step, in the 3rd text box "Regop:" and "Reged:" input keywords, you want to grab the elements on the right button to review the elements, for example:

img style="height: 700px;" src="https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1429095687696-3227bb0aa9a8?q=75&amp;fm=jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bf9adea15c02d630f71971a0dbbe1ed4" class="img-responsive js-fluid-image js-packery-image" alt="Photo By Shlomit Wolf" data-width="3888" data-height="2592"

you can know, src = "path of image" is cited pictures format, but keyword prefix and suffix may not the same, here is " class" (with particular attention to the spaces), baidu is mostly "pic_sytle", different period ties' format aren't the same.
5. step, in the 4th text box "Url:" input the URL, and then click on the "DownLoad" button, if you do not download the success, please check the key word.
